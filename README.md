Dart MVVM
=========

Dart MVVM is a model-view-viewmodel framework for Goolge Dart. By now it is still alpha and 100% untested.

Deprecated
==========

Since Google is adding Web UI to Dart, it seems like this LIB is deprecated. There might be one good reason
to continue: Web UI needs manual triggering to reflect view model changes to the UI. This solution works
with the observable pattern and allows automatic updating in both directions.
